	<h1>Dog Years</h1>

	<p>Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. We often say a dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to
		account for
		their growth compared to a human of the same age. In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years
		in a
		human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life. How old would you be if you were a dog?</p>
	<p>Here’s how you convert your age from “human years” to “dog years”:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.</li>
		<li>Each year following equates to 4 dog years.</li>
	</ul>

	<script>
		let myName = prompt("What is your name?");
		let myAge = prompt('How old are you now? Put in just a number of years');
		let earlyYears = 2;
		earlyYears *= 10.5;
		myAge -= 2;
		let laterYears = myAge;
		laterYears *= 4;
		console.log(`earlyYears is ${earlyYears}`);
		console.log(`laterYears is ${laterYears}`);
		if (myAge > 0) {
			myAgeInDogYears = earlyYears + laterYears;
			alert(`Your name is ${myName}. You are ${myAge += 2} years old in human years which is ${myAgeInDogYears} years old in dog years. Respect the dogs and be kind to them!`);
		} else {
			alert(`Check your age. It was written improper and reload the page to start converter once again.`);
		}

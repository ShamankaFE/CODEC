	<p>
		Myanmar (formerly Burma) is a Southeast Asian nation of more than 100 ethnic groups, bordering India, Bangladesh,
		China,
		Laos and Thailand. Yangon (formerly Rangoon), the country's largest city, is home to bustling markets, numerous
		parks
		and lakes, and the towering, gilded Shwedagon Pagoda, which contains Buddhist relics and dates to the 6th century.
	</p>

	<p>Myanmar is an unexplored natural and cultural wonder that offers one of the best authentic experiences for the
		traveller
		to Asia. From the snow-covered rugged Himalayas in the north to the pristine deep blue waters in the south,
		Myanmar is a
		land blessed and abundant.</p>

	<p>The natural attractions include caves, corals, lakes, rivers, beaches, islands, and mountains, whilst the
		connoisseur of
		culture and history will find pagodas, an array of vibrant festivals, 135 tribes and a spread of delicious cuisine
		to
		tantalise their taste buds.
